This is the source code for VR game A Day in Black.

The game was created in Unity 2018.2.0f2.

A Day in Black is a VR game created for Oculus VR. In the game, players are deprived of visual cues completely. 
The players will use the left thumbstick to move and the right thumbstick to rotate. 
However, in entirely dark, players lose track of their directions quickly. 
When their controllers collide with walls, they will start vibrating, which tells players that they run into obstacles. 
Players need to use that to navigate in the completely dark maze and reach a hidden goblet to clear the game. 
When players reach the goblet, the whole scene will be lit up so that they can go back and see how simple the maze is. 
To simplify the testing process and reduce the difficulty, we also added a cheat function -- Players can turn on flashlights in their hands by pressing down the thumbsticks. 

I created this game with a friend. We contributed equally to designing and programming. 
We wanted the game to be a mirror world of how blind people view the world. 
When we talk about the mirror world and other fancy concepts relating to VR, it is always about transforming our “ordinary realities” into cooler virtual realities. 
However, what we see as ordinary may be a privilege to others. We want to use this project to explore new ways of designing VR experience. 
We also want to use the game to ask players to show more respect and care to minority people.
